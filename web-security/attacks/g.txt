Questions
- not sure what role of username script is
with respect to the gamma_starter file?
    - do we just copy over that script here? plausible.
        - i.e. is gamma_starter just for testing?

- Can't just use the script tag in the below
cos stripped out by router.js (line 188). 
So need some alternative. I believe mixing
lower and upper case should not match the regex
and still be valid html.
