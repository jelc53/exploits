# Description of (resources used for) defenses
## Alpha: Cookie Theft
- filter out the invalid usernames manually
    - assignment tells us not to use frameworks for this

- if invalid username, just return error message


## Bravo: Cross-Site Request Forgery
Embed CSRF token in hidden form field in the form in transfer/form.ejs
 
Use generateRandomness function from ./utils/crypto to generate CSRF token
Use the HMAC function from .utils/crypto to sign the CSRF token and check to prevent 
tampering.
    - this is necessary since hidden form field is modifiable w/ developer tools

TODO
- create token in router.js/transfer every 5 minutes?
    - in terms of location, /transfer seems the best spot cos close to /post_transfer but not the same (can't be the same)

- if they can live in process memory can they be global variables?


## Charlie: Session Hijacking with Cookies
- generate session token using KDF(currtime, randomnonce);
- 


## Delta: Cooking the Books with Cookies
- sign and check the session obj?



## Echo: SQL Injection

TODO
- do we need to fix the SQL injection vulns in other places?

## Foxtrot: Profile Worm


## Gamma: Password Extraction via Timing attacker
