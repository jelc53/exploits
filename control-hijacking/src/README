==================================
155: Computer Security Spring 2023
==================================

Project 1
=========

The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience finding
vulnerabilities in code and mounting buffer overflow attacks. In Parts 1 and 2,
you are given the source code for five exploitable programs which are to be
installed with setuid root in a virtual machine we provide. You'll have to
identify a vulnerability (buffer overflow, double free, format string
vulnerability, etc.) in each program. You'll write an exploit for each that
executes the vulnerable program with crafted argument, causing it to jump to an
exploit string. In each instance, the result will yield a root shell even
though the attack was run by an unprivileged user. In Part 3, you will use a
fuzzer to find a vulnerability in a program called bsdtar, part of a widely
used library called libarchive. You'll download and build the vulnerable
version of libarchive in your VM and then run the fuzzer to find an input that
causes the program to crash.

The Environment
---------------

You'll run your exploits in a virtual machine (VM) emulated using QEMU.
This serves two purposes. First, the vulnerable programs contain real,
exploitable vulnerabilities and we strongly advise against installing them with
setuid root on your machine. Second, everything from the particular compiler
version, to the operating system and installed library versions will affect the
exact location of code on the stack. The VM provides an identical environment
to the one in which the assignment will be tested for grading.

The VM is configured with Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye), with ASLR (address
randomization) turned off. It has a single user account "user" with password
"cs155", but you can temporarily become the root user using sudo. The
exploits will be run as "user" and should yield a command line shell
(/bin/sh) running as "root". The VM comes with a set of tools pre-installed
(curl, wget, openssh, gcc, vim etc), but feel free to install additional
software. For example, to install the emacs editor, you can run as root:

    # apt-get install emacs

When you first run the VM, it will have an OpenSSH server running so you can
login from your host machine as well as transfer files using, e.g., ssh
and scp. You can login to the VM from your host machine using the
command:

    $ ssh -p 5555 user@localhost

The VM already contains the starter code in the proj1 directory.


Parts 1 and 2
=============

Parts 1 and 2 ask you to develop exploits for five different vulnerable target
programs.

Targets
-------

The targets/ directory in the assignment tarball (which has already been copied
to the VM for you) contains the source code for the vulnerable targets as well
as a Makefile for building and installing them on the VM. Specifically, to
install the target programs, as the non-root "user":

    $ cd targets
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

This will compile all of the target programs, set the executable stack flag on
each of the resulting executables, and install them with setuid root in /tmp.

Your exploits must assume that the target programs are installed in /tmp/ such
as /tmp/target1, /tmp/target2, etc. Each time you reboot you VM, you will need
to run `sudo make install` again to place the targets in the correct directory.

Exploit Skeleton Code
---------------------

The xploits/ directory in the assignment tarball contains skeleton code for the
exploits you'll write, named xploit1.c, xploit2.c, etc., to correspond with the
targets. Also included is the header file shellcode.h, which provides a
shellcode in the static variable static const char* shellcode.


Part 3
======

In Part 3 you'll learn how to find security vulnerabilities using a fuzzer
called American Fuzzy Lop. Fuzzing is a technique for finding vulnerabilities
in a program by running the program on random data until it crashes. We will be
using afl-fuzz, one of the most successful and widely-used fuzzers currently
available. afl-fuzz has already been installed on the VM. You can read more
about afl-fuzz and how it works at http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/.

Fuzzing libarchive
------------------

You will be fuzzing libarchive (https://www.libarchive.org/), a widely used
archive and compression library. It provides a program called bsdtar that
offers similar functionality to the more common GNU tar program. For example,
you can use bsdtar to extract a .tar.gz file in the same way as regular tar:

    $ bsdtar -xf <some-file>.tar.gz

In the proj1/fuzz/ directory, download and extract the source code for
libarchive version 3.1.2:

    $ curl -O http://www.libarchive.org/downloads/libarchive-3.1.2.tar.gz
    $ tar -xf libarchive-3.1.2.tar.gz

This should give you a directory called libarchive-3.1.2/. In that
directory, run:

    $ CC=afl-gcc ./configure --prefix=$HOME/proj1/fuzz/install

This will configure libarchive so that it will be built using the afl-fuzz
compiler, afl-gcc, and so that it will install itself in the install/ directory
rather than system-wide. You can then build and install libarchive, including
bsdtar:

    $ make
    $ make install

(Note that we are not using sudo.) After this, bsdtar should be installed under
install/bin/.

The fuzz/testcases/ directory contains a seed testcase that afl-fuzz will
modify to try to crash bsdtar.  Run afl-fuzz on this testcase by running the
following command from the fuzz/ directory:

    $ afl-fuzz -i testcases -o results install/bin/bsdtar -O -xf @@

This command instructs afl-fuzz to run bsdtar and supply the arguments -O -xf
@@. The -O (capital-O, not numeral-0) option tells bsdtar to not write any
files to disk. afl-fuzz will replace @@ with the name of the input to test for
a crash, so the -xf @@ part will cause bsdtar to try to extract the input file
generated by afl-fuzz. The result is that afl-fuzz will generate a bunch of
test cases based on the seeds in the testcases/ directory and then run bsdtar
on each generated file until bsdtar crashes.

The fuzzer may run for several minutes before finding a crash. Once it does,
hit Ctrl-C to stop AFL.

Write-up
--------

Spend a few minutes investigating the crash. Use GDB to get a backtrace at the
time of the crash. Try to figure out what the vulnerability is in the source
code.

In the fuzz/README file, include your backtrace from GDB and briefly describe
the vulnerability (two or three sentences; no more than 200 words).


Deliverables
============

The assignment is divided into three parts:

1. Part 1 (due on April 13th 11:59pm) consists of targets 1 and 2.

2. Part 2 consists of the other four targets.

3. Part 3 (which you will submit together with Part 2) consists of fuzzing a
   real-world program (bsdtar) to find a vulnerability.

For each submission, you'll need to provide a gzipped tarball (.tar.gz)
generated by running make submission from the top-level directory of the
assignment source (proj1/). This tarball will contain the contents of the
sploits/ directory, the crashes found during fuzzing, the README in the
fuzz/ directory, and ID.csv.
Make sure that if you extract your submission tarball:

1. In the extracted sploits/ directory, running make with no arguments should
   yield sploit1 through sploit6 executables in the same directory.

2. In the extracted fuzz/ directory, running the vulnerable version of bsdtar
   on any of the crashing testcases should reproduce the crash.

3. In the extracted fuzz/ directory, there should be a README file that
   describes the vulnerability found via fuzzing.

4. The tarball must include the file ID.csv which conatins a comma-separated
   line for each group member with your SUID number, Leland username, last
   name, first name (order matters). The top-level directory already contains
   such a file, so you just need to modify it.

NOTE: Due to the size of the class, the correctness of your
submission will be graded primarily by script. As a result, following the the
submission format is important. We really, really want to give you full credit!
Help us help you!

Instructions for submitting the tarball will be posted on Piazza.


Extra Credit
============

The extra credit for this assignment is quite different from the rest of the
assignment. Most significantly, you'll mount an exploit on a binary that has
stack canaries turned on (specifically, GCC's stack protector). Because of the
nature of exploits on canaries, you'll be attacking the program over the
network rather than by invoking it through a call to exec. This will also
require different shell code.

The Vulnerable Program
----------------------

In the targets/ directory, extra-credit.c is a forking network echo server. It
listens for TCP connections on port 5555, for each connection it forks and, in
the child process, reads in lines (separated by a carriage return and newline
characters, ) from the client, echoes them back until it reads an empty line.
You're goal is to construct a payload to send over the network that redirects
execution of the child process handling your connection to unlink the file
/tmp/passwd. To achieve this you'll have to do two things:

1. Write new shell code that unlinks the file /tmp/passwd instead of execing
   /bin/sh. We've provided a file shellcode.S with the latter and a Makefile
   target (shellcode.bin) that compiles the shellcode into binary format such
   that it can be used in your exploit.

2. In the sploits directory, we've included a python script extra-credit.py
   that can serve as skeleton code for your exploit. It reads in shellcode.bin
   (which is compiled from shellcode.S), as well as connects to the vulnerable
   server. Modify extra-credit.py to mount your exploit. Note that the function
   tryexploit takes an exploit string and the connection socket, sends the
   exploit string across and returns True if the connection died and False if
   it is still alive (how can you use this signal?).


Extra Credit Deliverables

For the extra credit, you should include two files in your submission.tar.gz:

1. A text file extra-credit.txt in the sploits/ directory with
   no more than 500 words answering the questions:

   a. How does your exploit work?

   b. What would you modify GCC's stack canaries mechanism, or Linux's fork
      syscall to protect against your attack?

2. The modified file extra-credit.py.

Hints
-----

Suppose you overflowed a buffer such that only a single byte of the
canary is overwritten. If the process crashes and the connection is closed,
what does that tell you? Conversely, if it doesn't crash, what does that tell
you?

The syscall number for unlink is 0x0a (10 in decimal), which is also the
newline character in ASCII. Does this matter? How might you get around this?

You can debug a running process with gdb by passing the -p argument with
process ID of the target process. Note that each child process (the result of
fork will have a different process ID).

We strongly encourage you to use a NOP slide for this problem, even if you are
able to find an exact address for the shellcode. In previous years we've
noticed some variability in the exact position of things in memory that
resulted in some student's solutions failing in the grading VM. Using a NOP
slide will help prevent this problem.


Late Policy
===========

The general course policy on late submissions applies to this assignment. The
policy is details in the course overview on the website:
http://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/info.html


Setup: Set-by-step
==================

Download the VM from
http://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/hw_and_proj/proj1/vm-cs155.tar.gz and
extract. The tarball contains a file CS155.ova, which is an Open Virtualization
Format archive of the virtual machine.

Import the virtual machine using VirtualBox. We strongly recommend using
VirtualBox. VirtualBox is free for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and the virtual
machine was developed and tested using VirtualBox. To import the virtual
machine, choose "File", "Import Appliance", and select the CS155.ova file.
This will set up a new virtual machine called CS155. Note that you might need
to set network adapter 2 to use a host-only network if SSH doesn't work out of
the box.

Once the VM has booted, login with username "user" and password "cs155".
Your home directory will now contain the folder "proj1" which contains the
targets and starter code for the project. The VM should be configured with a
host-only network adapter and static IP address 192.168.56.155, so you should
also be able to log in using SSH from your host:

    $ ssh user@192.168.56.155

Once logged in, build and install the targets:

    $ cd proj1/targets
    $ make && sudo make install
Password: cs155

Write, build and test your exploits:

    $ cd ../sploits
...edit,test...
    $ make
    $ ./sploit1

If at any point you'd like a fresh copy of the starter code, you can download
the assignment tarball from
http://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/hw_and_proj/proj1/proj1.tar.gz and
extract it:

    $ wget http://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/hw_and_proj/proj1/proj1.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf proj1.tar.gz

Then repeat the build and installation steps above.
